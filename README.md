# Fake News Classification

## Overview

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to classify news articles as fake or real. The model was trained on a labeled dataset and achieves high performance in identifying fake news.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for each article.

title: The title of the news article.

author: The author of the news article.

text: The main content of the article.

label: The classification label (1 for fake news, 0 for real news).

## Metrics

Accuracy: 91%
Precision: 90% (macro avg)
Recall: 91% (macro avg)
F1-Score: 90% (macro avg)

## Usage

Run the LSTM model to classify news articles and evaluate their credibility. For setup and usage instructions, refer to the project files.
